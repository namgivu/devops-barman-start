# configuration
Barman's config files loaded in below order - INI format
* `global`                config at **/etc/barman.conf** for main directory, user, log file, etc.   
* `per-postgres-instance` config at **/etc/barman.d/your-instance.conf** one for each server
the later definition will overwrite any repeated entry

config file template for **/etc/barman.conf**
```ini
[barman]
# global config 1 here
# global config 2 here

[your-server-name]
# server config 1 here
# server config 2 here

[all]
# command 1 to run on every server managed by Barman
# command 2 in sequence
```
section `[your-server-name]` better be save as separate file in **/etc/barman.d** e.g. /etc/barman.d/your-server-name.conf
                                                                                  e.g. /etc/barman.d/pg.conf  

see all configure-able at http://docs.pgbarman.org/barman.5.html
or by cmd `man 5 barman`

more detailed templates as in distributed package 
  * /etc/          barman.conf

## about global config file at **/etc/barman.conf**
global config is defined by `configuration_files_directory` entry #TODO where define this? 
default as **/etc/barman.d** - Barman will load **any *.conf files** defined here
eg.
per-instance config sections defined in /etc/barman.conf 
can be splited into parts eg. /etc/barman.d/part1.conf, /etc/barman.d/part2.conf, etc. as much as you want

here we put all in /etc/barman.conf for simplicity
when you get more familiar with Barman, a nicer config-file setup would be
  00 /etc/barman.d/your-team/00.global.conf
  01 /etc/barman.d/your-team/01.pg-instance1.conf
  02 /etc/barman.d/your-team/02.pg-instance2.conf
  etc.

open global config
```bash
sudoer@backup $ sudo nano /etc/barman.conf
```
where we config as below
```conf
[barman]
compression  = gzip
reuse_backup = link         # when creating full backups of the PostgreSQL server, Barman will try to save space by using link/symlink
immediate_checkpoint = true # ensure when Barman starts a full backup, it will request PostgreSQL to perform a CHECKPOINT
                            ie. checkpoints ensures any modified data in postgres's cache are written to data files

basebackup_retry_times = 3  # retry 03 times if backup fails
basebackup_retry_sleep = 6 # each retry be delayed in 6 sec

last_backup_maximum_age = 1 DAYS             # base backup file's age     - the last full backup NOT older than 03 days
retention_policy = RECOVERY WINDOW OF 7 days # base backup + wal file age - be able to recover our database to any time of the last seven days
```
TODO reuse_backup not recognized by Barman, why? 

full sample global config
```conf
[barman]
barman_home = /var/lib/barman
...
barman_user = barman
log_file = /var/log/barman/barman.log

compression = gzip
reuse_backup = link
...
immediate_checkpoint = true
...
basebackup_retry_times = 3
basebackup_retry_sleep = 6

last_backup_maximum_age = 1 DAYS
```


## per-instance config
note we mark per-instance section by `[per-instance-name]` eg. `[pg]`  
we can make as much block like this as possible for each postgres instance ie. `[standby]`

here we define connection to the postgres instance, and some backup settings specific for that instance
```conf
[pg]
description = main postgres instance

ssh_command = ssh postgres@pg
conninfo    = host=pg  user=barman dbname=postgres

retention_policy      = RECOVERY WINDOW OF 7 days
wal_retention_policy  = main
retention_policy_mode = auto
```

bash util to add the config as below
again be reminded that we define here in **one-combined** file at `/etc/barman.conf`
we can of course separate `[pg]` section into separated file as personal favor
```bash
sudoer@backup $ echo "

;region my barman config
compression  = gzip
reuse_backup = link         
immediate_checkpoint = true 

basebackup_retry_times = 3  
basebackup_retry_sleep = 6 

last_backup_maximum_age = 1 DAYS             
retention_policy = RECOVERY WINDOW OF 7 days


[pg]
description = main postgres instance

ssh_command = ssh postgres@pg
conninfo    = host=pg  user=barman dbname=postgres

retention_policy      = RECOVERY WINDOW OF 7 days
wal_retention_policy  = main
retention_policy_mode = auto
 
archiver = on
;endregion my barman config
" | sudo tee -a /etc/barman.conf
```
          

## last config - switch on backup for the postgres instance
locate backup folder
```bash
barman@pg $ barman show-server "$pg" | grep incoming_wals_directory
```
sample output
> incoming_wals_directory: /var/lib/barman/pg/incoming
> incoming_wals_directory: /var/lib/barman/$pg/incoming 

NOTE the `$pg` in above path - it is your instance name placeholder 
eg. if the per-instance section you defined, in Barman config files ie. `/etc/barman.conf`, 
    as `[pg]` then $pg must be `pg` in this path 

we now USING THIS PATH to config `archive_command` for the postgres instance
open :postgresql.conf to edit
```bash
postgres@pg $ nano `psql -t -c 'show config_file'` # we got postgresql.conf location eg. /etc/postgresql/10/main/postgresql.conf
```
we now update the file to turn on postgres backup/archive mode as below
```conf
wal_level = archive # choices eg. minimal, archive, hot_standby, or logical #TODO what these values mean
archive_mode = on
archive_command = 'rsync -a  %p                      barman@backup:/var/lib/barman/pg/incoming/%f' # command to use to archive a logfile segment
                             ;from local wal files   ;copied to remote path      
```
bash util
```bash
barman@backup $ barman show-server `barman list-server --minimal` | grep incoming_wals_directory \
                echo 'use :incoming_wals_directory path to fill in :archive_command below'
postgres@pg $ echo "
# gc barman config
wal_level = archive 
archive_mode = on
archive_command = 'rsync -a  %p  barman@backup:/var/lib/barman/pg/incoming/%f' 
" | tee -a `psql -t -c 'show config_file'`
```

finally don't forget to RESTART postgres instance
```bash
sudoer@pg $ sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart
```
