# sample create backup 
```bash
barman@backup $ barman backup "$pg"
```

backup file will be created at folder **/var/lib/barman/$pg/**
```bash
barman@backup $ ls /var/lib/barman
# /var/lib/barman   /base       # base backup file stored here
# /var/lib/barman   /incoming   # completed wal files sent here
# /var/lib/barman   /wals       # files here copied from :incoming 
```

> During a restoration, Barman will recover contents in **base** into the target server's **data directory** 
  Then files in **wals** folder are used to apply transaction changes and bring the target server to a consistent state.
